## What is it?

PieceOfKit is a Cocoa Touch framework written in Swift 3 for iOS 9 and over. It contains useful extensions to basic types and some helpers methods. Initially inspired by projects like [EZSwiftExtensions](https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensions) and [ExSwift](https://github.com/pNre/ExSwift), I added things I use often under one roof. You can find a list of what it does at [nicoschuele.github.io/PieceOfKit/](https://nicoschuele.github.io/PieceOfKit/).

## Design Goals

* Have a one stop shop for code reuse between different apps
* Be fully documented

## Installation

Although a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org) will be available soon, it's not quite there yet. For now, you'll need to `git clone https://github.com/nicoschuele/PieceOfKit.git` and add the PieceOfKit framework manually to your project. Don't know how to do it? Ray Wenderlich has an [step by step guide here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126365/ios-frameworks-tutorial).

## Documentation & Usage

PieceOfKit is fully documented at [nicoschuele.github.io/PieceOfKit/](https://nicoschuele.github.io/PieceOfKit/).

## Contribute

Are there pieces of code you constantly reuse between apps? Extensions you copy-paste from one project to another? Well, you may consider adding them to PieceOfKit so people can use them as well.

* Fork the code.
* Implement your new feature.
* **Document it**! This is not optional. Check some methods already in PieceOfKit to see how it's done.
* As much as possible, write unit tests. Add them to `PieceOfKitTests`.
* Submit a pull request. One and only one per feature. Don't group them, thanks!
